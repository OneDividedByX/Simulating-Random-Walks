- Simple program to simulate the evolution of some random walks
- There are only two main types of functions: "simulate_" and "graph_", which purposes are specified in "Read.txt"
- For the moment, if any parameter is confusing just use the available ones. Those are easy to check in the definitions of the functions, where the parameters values are specified on each conditional branching.
